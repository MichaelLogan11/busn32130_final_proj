# A Beginner's Guide to Personal Investing
This project was created by University of Chicago MBA students as a class project for Data Visualization for Decision-Making (BUSN32130), taught by Professor [Lara Kattan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/lara-kattan)

Team members: Gonzalo Tenorio, Michael Logan

## Overview
When breaking into the world of personal investing, there are a few questions that always need answering:
1. Why should I invest at all? Wouldn't it be safer to just keep my cash under the mattress like the good old days?
2. If I do decide to invest, when's the right time to start?
3. Once I'm in, how do I know where to put my money so I don't lose it all?

While these questions can be answered through countless Google searches or even a quick chat with ChatGPT, we wanted to make the investing journey more approachable. Instead of just reading about the benefits of investing, we created interactive visualizations that let new investors explore the data for themselves: showing, not just telling, why investing matters.

This project walks through key investing rationale that helps inform potential investors. It is inteded to not only explain the important features of investing, but to also give visual context that provides another way to comprehend complex topics. It is especially helpful for those brand new to investing and visual learners.
